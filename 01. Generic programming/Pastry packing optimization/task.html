<h2>Pastry packing optimization</h2>
<p>You were asked to help with Java programming for a pie company. At the moment, they bake pies, cakes, and tarts and
    pack them in nice boxes to sell. Unfortunately, their approach to box programming is quite outdated and each pie
    type requires its own box class. This approach is poorly scalable and will turn the situation into a nightmare with
    product range growth (imagine all these: ApplePieBox, StrawberryPieBox, etc.).</p>

<p>To avoid this, implement a universal <code>Box</code> class that will accommodate anything with <code>put</code> methods
    and give it back with <code>get</code> methods.</p>
